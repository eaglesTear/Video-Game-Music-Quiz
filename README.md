# Video-Game-Music-Quiz
A timed video game music quiz built with jQuery, JQuery UI and Javascript. Non-gamers may struggle, but this one's fun!

Contains fully-styled, dynamic UI and sound effects for added enjoyment.

I'll admit the JS code could be cleaner and use more functional programming concepts etc. This project was also early in my JS / programming life.

Originally, this was built to house at least 3 quiz pages in one using jQueryUI tabs, but I did not have time to go back and finish the other pages.

Just hit start game when ready, and you'll have 90 seconds to listen to a bunch of famous video game music tracks and select via radio buttons which game you think the track belongs to.

As you get dangerously close to timeout, an alarm will sound which you can disable.

Once you hit submit, your score will be tallied. Feel free to expand on this and add your own tracks and effects.
